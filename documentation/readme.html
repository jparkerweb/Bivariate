##### *An opinionated interface for writing, running, and saving BackstopJS tests*


## Goal
**Bivariate**'s ultimate goal is to allow for an approachable Visual Regression Testing suite that can be organized to accommodate small and large projects without overwhelming complexity.


## Installation
**Bivariate** runs in [Node](https://nodejs.org) and also requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) for it's DOM manipulation capabilities (leveraging CasperJS).

* Download the Latest version of Bivariate

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)

* Run the following from the command line (in the Bivariate directory):
`npm install`


## Folder Structure

*All tests, scripts, and configuration files are stored in the `bivariate_data` parent folder.*

`bivariate_data`  
|
+---- `test_scripts` holds user defined configuration and tests for to instruct BackstopJS
|
+---- `casper_scripts` holds user defined CasperJS scripts for interacting with the DOM before saving a screen shot
|
+---- `bitmaps_reference_archive` holds archived *references* that can be restored and tested against


### test_scripts

Out of the box, BackstopJS gets all of its config and test data from a single JSON file, which isn't very maintainable over time.  Luckily, **Bivariate** takes advantage of Node's module system to break this all apart and just return what is needed (*a simple array of objects*).

##### Configuration files

All configuration files are prefixed with a double underscore: \_\_

###### \_\_config-baseURLs.js
holds the *base* URLs for all References and Tests to be run.
```
...
  // do not use a trailing slash in the base URLs
  theURLS.baseURL = "http://your-base-url";
  theURLS.baseRefURL = "http://your-base-reference-url";
...
```

###### \_\_config-common.js
set of *common* config values (rendering engine, ports, etc.) that shouldn't need to be adjusted in most cases.

###### \_\_config-viewports.js
 configure any number of *viewports* to test against (this can include any number of defined screen resolutions).


##### Individual Tests
All individual tests are prefixed with a single underscore: \_


##### Test Groups
