# Example Site

This directory contains a sample site in its original state (`unchanged`), as well as with some css changes applied (`changed`).

The example site is a simple, straight-forward two page site.

### The differences applied to the `changed` version is the **size** of the logo and some misc. **padding** on a few elements.  
.

These two sites are hosted on Github pages and the example tests that Bivariate generates is already configured to work with them.  The urls are as follows:

* https://jparkerweb.github.io/Bivariate/unchanged/
* https://jparkerweb.github.io/Bivariate/changed/
