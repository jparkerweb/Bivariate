              <h1>Happy Text</h1>

              <p>Here we're <strong>limited</strong> by the time we have. We have a fantastic little sky! Let's make a nice big leafy tree. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to <em>talk to trees</em> and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. Get tough with it, get strong.</p>

              <h3>Little Touch of Yellow</h3>

              <p>We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.</p>

              <p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Be brave. Let your imagination be your guide. There it is.</p>

              <p>We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.</p>
